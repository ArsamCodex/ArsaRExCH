ArsarEXch
ArsarEXch is a CRUD application that I have been developing as a personal project, dedicating around 30 minutes to an hour daily. Throughout this journey, ChatGPT has been a valuable assistant, helping with various questions, from improving English text to developing C# methods and building Blazor components.

I have been coding since 2003, starting with Windows 98 and XP, and I’ve applied that experience to this project. ArsarEXch aims to demonstrate different approaches and implementations in a simple and readable way. The goal is to maintain a clean and straightforward codebase, with well-documented methods, comments, and explanations.
